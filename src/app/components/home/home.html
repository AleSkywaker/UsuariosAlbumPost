            We want you to make a graphical interface that displays a list of users who have associated posts and albums.
        Please use the API from https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/ using AJAX requests. The goal is to develop an admin
        site of a service where user can send a post to an album. There is no need to develop a CRUD for users, user list
        can be predefined or inserted by script to jsonplaceholder.typicode.com or use the users already available there.
        If the candidate wants to add the ability to randomly insert posts on albums, that ok. The appearance of UX / UI
        interface design is your free decision, any shortcut to include design/responsive/interaction/animation/etc. will
        be appreciated. The interface must contain: A Section with a list of users. If a user is selected, a subsection with
        a list of albums and a list of posts, both associated to the selected user, will be displayed. If an album is selected,
        a subsection with a list of images associated to the selected album and user will be displayed. If a post is selected,
        a subsection with the post information and all messages related to that post will be displayed. Ability to search
        by word any of the posts from any of the users on the main section, or if a user has been selected, search will be
        limited to the selected user (sub section). A general chart showing the number of posts and the number of albums
        per user (we recommend to use graphics library Highcharts). In the graph it should be possible to select which users
        want to display the graph. In addition it should be possible to select the graphic is done by the number of posts,
        the number of albums or the sum of both.
